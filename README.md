# Invisible Thread

## Purpose
Have you ever accidentally separated from your friends at a concert? Have you ever lost your vehicle in a sea of cars after a long day of shopping at the mall?

## What it does
Fear not, as we, the creators of InvisibleThread, have solved this cumbersome problem. We have created InvisibleThread to serve as a platform for augmented reality based peer-to-peer navigation.

In a nutshell, InvisibleThread generates indicator arrows pointing toward selected geolocations. Essentially, it will navigate you to your friends or car, regardless of how crowded the venue may be. Finding a needle in a haystack will be as easy as 1-2-3 with InvisibleThread.

InvisibleThread harnesses the technologies of Objective-C, Swift, Javascript, Ruby, Wikitude SDK, HTML5, CSS3, PostgreSQL, and many more! We decided to use a relatively large tech stack in order to learn about integrating different technologies with each other




## Deployment
InvisibleThread is not yet publicly deployed. However, a preview of our app is available through
