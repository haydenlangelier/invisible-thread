# Invisible Thread

Have you ever accidentally separated from your friends at a concert? Have you ever lost your vehicle in a sea of cars after a long day of shopping at the mall?

Fear not, as we, the creators of InvisibleThread, have solved this cumbersome problem. We have created InvisibleThread to serve as a platform for augmented reality based peer-to-peer navigation. In a nutshell, InvisibleThread generates indicator arrows pointing toward selected geolocations. Essentially, it will navigate you to your friends or car, regardless of how crowded the venue may be. Finding a needle in a haystack will be as easy as 1-2-3 with InvisibleThread.











A mobile app that uses augmented reality to guide you to your friends in crowded locations.
