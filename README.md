## Purpose
Have you ever accidentally separated from your friends at a concert? Have you ever lost your vehicle in a sea of cars after a long day of shopping at the mall? Well, we made an app for that!

## What it does
Fear not, as we, the creators of InvisibleThread, have solved this cumbersome problem. We have created InvisibleThread to serve as a platform for augmented reality based peer-to-peer navigation.

In a nutshell, InvisibleThread generates indicator arrows pointing toward selected geolocations. Essentially, it will navigate you to your friends or car, regardless of how crowded the venue may be. Finding a needle in a haystack will be as easy as 1-2-3 with InvisibleThread.

InvisibleThread harnesses the technologies of Objective-C, Swift, Javascript, Ruby, Wikitude SDK, HTML5, CSS3, PostgreSQL, and many more! We decided to use a relatively large tech stack in order to learn about integrating different technologies with each other

## Technologies Used
![alt-text](https://github.com/wfriebel/invisible-thread/blob/master/InvisibleThread/ArchitectWorld/assets/techstack.png)



## Successes
* Getting the app up and running (locally)
* Implementing Wikitude - setting up our AR environment
* GPS tracking based on geolocation


## Obstacles
* Understanding mobile app development (none of us had previous experience building iOS and Android apps)
* Learning how to implement SDK's
* Combining technologies
* Troubleshooting errors in newly learned languages
* Scheduling conflicts

## Future Plans
* Implement user base (0auth)
* Add friends from various contact lists
* Triangulate position for pinpoint accuracy
* Android platform...(currently in development)
* Deploy to App Store!
* Getting acquired by Facebook (please)


## Setup

* You will need: Wikitude Javascript API `Wikitude.framework` that can be downloaded [here](http://www.wikitude.com/download/)
* You will also need to generate a key and add it to `ViewController.swift`


## Thank You
We hope you appreciated our app! We are looking forward to deploying it to the App Store in the new future. Special thanks to Wikitude for providing us with an EDU license
